how to test react and android installation
-------------------------------------------------------------
ANDROID:
    react-native init projectname
    (start emulator)
    cd projectname
    react-native start > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
    (wait a second, depends on how fast your computer is)
    react-native run-android
    react-native log-android

NOTE: requires emulator running or android device connected
      to start emulator from command line:
           > android avd
      device settings: check the box to wipe user data on start,
           otherwise "launcher 3" might fail. also make sure 
           to initialize with at least these memory settings
                1024 RAM
                32 heap
                200 internal storage
            
            what works best for me:
                nexus 7 (7.02", 1200x1920: xhdpi)
                android 6.0 -api level 23
                intel atom x86_64
                no skin
                1024 ram
                32 vm heap
                200 mib internal storage

-------------------------------------------------------------
IOS:
open projectname in xcode
click run
react-native log-ios

NOTE: untested
      ios emulation requires xcode installation
